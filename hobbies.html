    My favourite thing to do is play football this requires strong communication and can build team building qualites. It allows me to build on my leadership and time management skills and also helps me handle pressure.

    I enjoy going to the gym as exercise is one of the best ways to help your brain health and memory. Exercise can also improve brain functioning.
